    Finalized project: Mobile Jukebox.
    <p>
      We will put speakers on top of the turtlebot to make a mobile jukebox.
      This will enable several interesting functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Follow mode: The jukebox will follow a person around while playing
          music that they have selected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Location mode: The jukebox will move to a specific point selected from
          a predefined set of locations and begin playing music.
        </li>
        <li>
          Voice commands: The jukebox will accept commands via voice. Location
          or follow mode can be activated, and specific songs can be chosen.
          Play, pause, and volume control will be supported. We may use a
          microphone on the turtlebot itself, but it might not work well while
          songs are playing. We will consider using microphones elsewhere.

      This is a video of our turtlebot following Adam. It first rotates to face
      him, then moves forward. Currently, the data processing is very slow, and
      it means that the turtlebot moves very slowly.

  <li>Ideas:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mobile Jukebox: The turtlebot responds to spoken requests for specific
        songs in specific locations
      </li>
      <li>
        Object Locator: Make easy-to-recognize objects, and have the robot
        search the area for the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        BeerBot: Web interface that allows ordering of beer (or other suitable
        beverages), using an attendant to load the beverage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Lab 2:<br/>
    <img src="images/roombo.png" width="100%" height="auto"/><br/>
    This is a picture of a simulated robot trapped in a room. The robot moves
    until it collides with a wall, and then backs up and rotates, similar to a
    roomba. The True/False on the right indicates when the wall was hit.
