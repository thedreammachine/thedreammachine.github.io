  <li>Ideas:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mobile Jukebox: The turtlebot responds to spoken requests for specific
        songs in specific locations
      </li>
      <li>
        Object Locator: Make easy-to-recognize objects, and have the robot
        search the area for the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        BeerBot: Web interface that allows ordering of beer (or other suitable
        beverages), using an attendant to load the beverage.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li>Lab 2:<br/>
    <img src="images/roombo.png" width="100%" height="auto"/><br/>
    This is a picture of a simulated robot trapped in a room. The robot moves
    until it collides with a wall, and then backs up and rotates, similar to a
    roomba. The True/False on the right indicates when the wall was hit.
